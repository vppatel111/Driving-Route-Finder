Vishal Patel - EA1

Accessories:
- 3 (560 Ohm resistors (Green Blue Brown))
- 4 Red LEDs
- 1 GREEN LED
- 2 Buttons
- 10 Wires

Wiring Instructions:
Arduino Pin 13 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 12 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 11 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 10 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 9 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 7 <--> Button <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 6 <--> Button <--> Arduino GND

To run the code:
- From command terminal: 1. Navigate to the CountingLights directory using "cd".
2. Connect the Arduino to the PC.
3. Type "make upload" to compile and upload the code to the Arduino.

Assumptions: -The user does not press the decrement button when all the lights
are off. (It just turns all the lights on.)

Additional Functionality: -None
